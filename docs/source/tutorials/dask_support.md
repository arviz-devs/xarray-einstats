# Dask support
Like xarray, xarray-einstats also aims to support using their functions on
NumPy or Dask backed xarray objects.

Functions in xarray-einstats should support Dask backed xarray objects.
But Dask support is still not extensively tested.
If you have issues using Dask backed xarray objects please open an [issue](https://github.com/arviz-devs/xarray-einstats)
